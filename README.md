# Loan Default Risk Segmentation Dashboard

This Tableau dashboard presents an analysis of **loan default risk patterns** using real-world BFSI metrics like **FICO scores, DTI (Debt-to-Income) ratios, loan status**, and **interest rates**. It helps identify borrower segments most likely to default and provides strategic insights for risk managers and underwriters.

## Project Highlights

- **Loan Status Breakdown:** Compares fully paid vs defaulted loans.
- **Average Interest Rate by Loan Status:** Reveals how interest rates vary with default risk.
- **DTI Band vs Default Rate:** Shows correlation between high DTI and increased defaults.
- **Loan Distribution by FICO Risk Tier:** Medium-risk borrowers dominate — a potential risk zone.

## Key Insights

- **High DTI bands** show the **highest default rates**.
- **Medium FICO score borrowers** represent the largest loan volume — requiring watchlist categorization.
- **Defaulters face higher interest rates**, impacting lending decisions.

## Tools Used

- **Tool:** Tableau Public  
- **Dataset:** Synthetic loan risk dataset  
- **Visualization Type:** Bar Charts, Distribution Analysis  
- **Domain:** Banking and Financial Services (BFSI)
